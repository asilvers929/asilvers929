Hi everyone!
I am currently a student at Somerset Community College.
I am working on a certificate in Cyber Defense Fundamentals and hoping to pursue an associates degree in this field.
Because I am new to this area of study, I am not sure what I'll be working on just yet; but I am very excited to get started!
I will probably need help and appreciate all the input anyone may offer.
I look forward to meeting and working with new people.
